"""
PyYAML audit for 4 GH Actions workflows.
Per memory rule: PyYAML 1.1 parses `on:` as boolean `True` — use d[True].
Applies to all workflow files; tracks the Sprint 9.6.2 fix invariants
(added 2026-07-08 after Sprint 9.6.1 PR #13 push CI FAIL).

Verifies:
  1. All 4 workflows have ONLY workflow_dispatch trigger (no push/pull_request).
  2. android-debug.yml has subosito/flutter-action@v2 step.
  3. android-debug.yml's `Setup Flutter` step pins flutter-version
     (Sprint 9.6.2 fix — Sprint 9.6.1 had `channel: stable` only, which
     caused ${FLUTTER_HOME} to resolve to empty in the runner).
  4. android-debug.yml's `Generate local.properties` step writes flutter.sdk
     echo derived from `which flutter` (Sprint 9.6.2 fix — Sprint 9.6.1
     used `${FLUTTER_HOME}` which was empty, causing settings.gradle.kts
     `includeBuild("")` = `/packages/flutter_tools/gradle` to FAIL).
  5. android-debug.yml has `Verify Flutter SDK path` step
     (fast-fail signal BEFORE ./gradlew assembleDebug).
  6. ci.yml/ios.yml/android-release.yml have NO inputs.runner
     (matrix/single-runner workflows don't need it).
